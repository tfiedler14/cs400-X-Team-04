# X-Team 04 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Weekly Scrum meetings to accept responsibilities. Use effective communication to reassign tasks when needed.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
The use of a group chat to mention when tasks are completed and uploaded. Weekly Scrum meetings can be used to 
ensure no one is unable to complete their tasks.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Asking for help during weekly Scrum meetings and not being afraid to speak up when in need. If needed, go for TA's office hour together.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Weekly Scrum meetings to ensure everyone is proactive rather than reactive. Be open and honest with conflicts,
concerns and issues.
